LBPL : Logic Based Programming Language
---
Use logic gates to program.
Similar to luna-lang or scratch, however with more focus on user friendlyness.

Flaws of luna-lang
- user experience is terrible, loading the editor takes forever, is buggy, and is extrememly slow
- not extrememly beginner friendly, to both programmers and newbies. Both need to learn how the editor works and how the code works.
- As I could barely run the editor, any further flaws haven't been found.
- not embedable (both the editor, and the language (afaik))

Pros of luna-lang
- somewhat intuitive, it just takes time to learn the editor
- if the editor worked correctly, it would be amazing

Flaws of scratch / blocky
- not intuitive when writing actual code.
- does not scale
- it's hard to tell what's happening at a glance

Pros of scratch / blocky
- beginner friendly. While it may not be useful for writing actual code, it does a good job teaching it by keeping the visual elements simple.
- it can easily be extended and embedded into websites (blocky)
