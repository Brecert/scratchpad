R <- Ring Quality
G <- Gem Quality

When two people have a ring, and shift right click on eachother, they get married.

`datapack uses scoreboards to handle this information`

`plugins uses a yaml config file`

Marriage is mostly cosmetic, however, when the two players are near, they may recieve random buffs.

(speed increase, regen, luck, etc..)

And if one of them dies, it notifies the other of the death location.
