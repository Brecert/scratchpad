Sm4sh mod.
Keep vanilla feel of game.
No gameplay changes.
Should be able to load up the mod, and game feels like it got an update from the creators itself.

Each character gets 8 new skins.
Each skin should fit, have a reason to be in, and not be overdone.
Models shouldn't really be included unless they are high enough quality.

Small tweaks may be nessisary or even wanted to make the game fit a more unified (mod wise) feel.
