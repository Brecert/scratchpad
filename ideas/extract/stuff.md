Sm4sh mod.
Keep vanilla feel of game.
No gameplay changes.
Should be able to load up the mod, and game feels like it got an update from the creators itself.

Each character gets 8 new skins.
If 8 skins are not possible, then atleast 4. (usually new model based, like olimar & alph)
Each skin should fit, have a reason to be in, and not be overdone.
Models shouldn't really be included unless they are high enough quality.

Small tweaks may be nessisary or even wanted to make the game fit a more unified (mod wise) feel.

## Notes
Anything from [vaanrose](https://gamebanana.com/members/1474375) should be allowed in if tweaked.

The vanillask of his stuff really fits the game.

# Menu Tweaks
  - [Unique Nameplates](https://gamebanana.com/guis/31600)
    * Fits the game perfectly, I'm surprised something like this wasn't already in it.
  - [Unique Stageplates](https://gamebanana.com/guis/32246)
    * Doesn't fit it perfectly, but it's pretty close.
  - [Modded Skins Warning](https://gamebanana.com/guis/31935)
    * If you can't make it all work use this (but everything should work seamlessly (like vanilla) anyways)
